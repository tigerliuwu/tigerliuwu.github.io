**overview**<br/>
在传统的金融机构中，数据模型通常是由下面的三个概念开始的：客户(customer)-帐号(account)-交易(transaction),即(C-A-T)。换句话说，就是客户跟帐号
关联，帐号跟交易关联；在保险行业，客户(customer)跟保单(Policies)关联，保单跟理赔(Claims)关联。
<br/>这里对主题模型中十大主题进行描述。

### Product
    产品可以是任何可销售产品或者服务，这种产品必须由金融机构和保险公司出售给客户进行使用。
如果需要的话，也可以将其它的金融相关的产品包含进来，例如存单(certificate of deposit), 活期账户(checking accounts),
贷款(loans)，保单(insurance polices)，保险箱(safe deposit boxes)，汇票(money orders),公证(notary service),
stocks（股票），债券(bonds)。
    产品也可以是一系列产品构成的产品包。
